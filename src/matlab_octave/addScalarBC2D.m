function [A, b] = addScalarBC2D(A, b, k, m, dx, n, dy, dc, nc, v)
% This function assumes that the unknown u, which represents the discrete
% solution the continuous second-order 2D PDE operator 
%                                   L U = f, 
% with continuous boundary condition 
%                              a0 U + b0 dU/dn = g,
% are given at the 2D cell centers and boundary face centers. Furthermore,
% all discrete calculations are performed at the 2D cell centers and boundary 
% face centers.
%
% The function receives as input quantities associated to the discrete
% analog of the continuous problem given by the squared linear system 
%                                 A u = b 
% where A is the discrete analog of L and b is the discrete analog of g,
% both constructed by the user without boundary conditions.
% The function output is the modified square linear system 
%                                 A u = b
% where both A and b include boundary condition information.
%
% The boundary condition is always one of the following forms:
%
% For Dirichlet set: a0 not equal zero and b0 = 0.
% For Neumann set  : a0 = 0 and b0 not equal zero.
% For Robin set    : both a0 and b0 not equal zero.
% For Periodic set : both a0 = 0 and b0 = 0.
%
% For periodic bc, it is assumed that not only u but also du/dn are the same 
% in both extremes of the domain since a second-order PDE is assumed.
%
% Periodic boundary conditions can be applied along some axes and
% non-periodic to some others.
% 
% For consistence with the way boundary operators are calculated to avoid 
% overwriting of the values v, the left and right boundary conditions are
% assumed to be column vectors of (m+2)*n components, and the bottom and 
% top faces are assumed to be vectors of (m+2)*(n+2) components. 
%
% The order of these components is as follows:
% For left and right edges, the ordering is the one given by columns vectors
% where x increases. For bottom and top faces, the ordering is the one given 
% by columns vectors where y increases.
%
% The code assumes the following assertions:
% assert(k >= 2, 'k >= 2');
% assert(mod(k, 2) == 0, 'k % 2 = 0');
% assert(m >= 2*k+1, ['m >= ' num2str(2*k+1) ' for k = ' num2str(k)]);
%
% Parameters:
% output
%         A : Linear operator with boundary conditions added
%         b : Right hand side with boundary conditions added
%
% input
%         A : Linear operator without boundary conditions added

%        dx : Step size horizontal cells
%         n : Number of vertical cells

%         v : g (4x1 vector of arrays for left, right, bottom, top boundaries, resp.)
